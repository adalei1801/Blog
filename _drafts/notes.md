# Notes

This file is meant to keep the draft folder from disappearing

I will use it for notes

## Bulletin Board

- Post Clicker game post
- Try something not tech related
    - TV Show or media essay maybe



## Future Posts Ideas

- Unit test practical portion
    - And other edits made to code

- Something not tech related

- Make the blog guide its own post
    - <p style="color: red">Do not take it out of drafts folder, make separate file</p>

- Add that "---" (three dashes) make a horizontal line in markdown
    - Similar to heading underlines
